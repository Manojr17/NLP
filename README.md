What is NLP (Natural Language Processing)?

   *Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
   *It combines linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

How NLP Works?
   *NLP involves several subfields and techniques that help machines understand and process human language.

TEXT PREPROCESSING
   *Before a machine can analyze text, it must be cleaned and prepared. Key preprocessing steps include:

   1)Tokenization – Splitting text into words or sentences.
Example: "I love NLP!" → ["I", "love", "NLP", "!"]

   2)Lowercasing – Converting all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
Example: "HELLO" → "hello"

   3)Stopword Removal – Removing common words like "is," "the," "and" that don’t add much meaning.
   
  4)Stemming & Lemmatization – Reducing words to their root form.
         -Stemming Example: "running" → "run"
         -Lemmatization Example: "better" → "good"
         
  5)Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging – Identifying words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
Example: "The cat sat" → ("The", DET), ("cat", NOUN), ("sat", VERB)

  6)Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Identifying names, places, dates, etc.
Example: "Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002." → ("Elon Musk", PERSON), ("SpaceX", ORG), ("2002", DATE)

Applications of NLP:
      📚 Search Engines – Google, Bing use NLP to rank and retrieve results.
      📧 Spam Filters – Email services use NLP to detect spam.
      💬 Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT.
      📰 Fake News Detection – Identifies misinformation.
      📖 Automatic Text Summarization – Summarizes articles, documents.
      🌍 Machine Translation – Google Translate, DeepL.
